# AES

In 2012, there was a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/asap-aes/data) challenge on Automated Essay Scoring (AES), sponsored by The Hewlett Foundation. More recently, in 2024, a new [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-agency-lab-automated-essay-scoring-2) challenge was launched with a larger dataset as part of the Automated Student Assessment Prize (ASAP) initiative. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lburleigh/asap-2-0?resource=download) used in this project is based on that 2024 release.
